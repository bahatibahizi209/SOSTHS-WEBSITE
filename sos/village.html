<h1 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:25;color:#00aeef">GIKONGORO</h1><br>
<p style="font-size:15px;letter-spacing:1px">SOS Children’s Villages Nyamagabe was established in 1992 and the first two children were admitted on June 24th, 1992. Its establishment was motivated by a severe famine that threatened Gikongoro region at that time and the neighbouring area of Mulico was particularly affected.<br><br>

Thus, three weeks after the official opening of the village out of 15 children admitted nine came from Mulico. The opening of the Village took place concurrently with the opening of Herman Gmeiner Primary School and the Children’s Garden, which was originally built to house a nutrition centre due to famine in the area.<br><br>

On the eve of the Genocide perpetrated against the Tutsis in April 1994, the village already had 57 children. Three more were admitted between April and mid-June 1994. When all the children and many of their educators moved on June 13th, 1994 to SOS CV Bukavu the village had 60 children. They were welcomed in SOS CV Bukavu family houses where they continued to receive assistance from SOS Children’s Villages International.</p>

Following that situation, SOS Children’s Villages Byumba was established in Kageyo (in Byumba town).</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;letter-spacing:1px">Kayonza location is situated in the eastern province, Kayonza District, Nyamirama Sector. It is 60km from Kigali International airport. It is built on a land of 4 hectors bought secured and has a new infrastructure.<br><br>

It started in September 2010 to respond to the alarming problems of children such as orphanage, abandonment, and separation of children from their families. The later effects resulted from polygamy, high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, family conflicts, a big number of children per household, poverty, and unemployment, migration to other provinces and neighboring countries in the region, etc.<br><br>

It is a loving home for 68 children who live with their SOS mothers and aunts in 11 family houses. Others five hundred children are being supported on the family strengthening program which is our outreach program to the community. Kayonza location is operating 5 programs which include; family-like care, Educational and Health, family strengthening, advocacy, and alternative care.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;letter-spacing:1px">  
  The first SOS Children’s Village (Kigali location) was established in Rwanda in 1979 dedicated to the International Year of the Child. Various reasons justified the support SOS Children’s Village Rwanda offered to children.<br><br>

Due to the escalation of the violence that was affecting children, SOS Children’s Village Kigali had to be evacuated in 1994 and the children were moved to safer emergency accommodation. In 1995, the situation had stabilized enough for children and co-workers to move back to the children’s village.
